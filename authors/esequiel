I'm a software engineer with vast experience helping startups to build solid products that can last in time, overcoming any obstacles, not just technically but also on the business side. I'm passionate about software, always keep myself up to date with the latest technologies (and the old ones), and I love to teach and mentor people starting in the software development world.
